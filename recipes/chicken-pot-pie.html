            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Do all prep work, like cubing the chicken, cutting the carrot, onion and celery. 
                    Gather all the rest of your ingredients. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F(220 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>Combine the chicken, carrots, peas, and celery into a saucepan. Add water until 
                    it covers ingredients. Bring it to a boil, and boil for 15 minutes, Remove 
                    from heat, then drain water.
                </li>
                <li>While chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan at medium heat. Add 
                    onion and cook until soft and translucent, which takes 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in 
                    your flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.
                </li>
                <li>Slowly stir in your chicken broth and milk to the onion mix. Reduce heat to 
                    medium low and simmmer until thick, which is 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat 
                    and set broth aside.
                </li>
                <li>Take your pie crust and place chicken and vegetable mix into the bottom pie crust. 
                Pour hot broth over top of mixture.
                </li>
                <li>Cover with the cop crust, sealing the edges, and cutting away any excess dough. 
                    Cut small slits in the top crust so steam can escape.
                </li>
                <li>Place in preheated oven, cook for 30 to 35 minutes, or until pastry is golden 
                    brown and filling is bubbly. Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. </li>
                    <li><strong><em>ENJOY!!!</em></strong></li>
